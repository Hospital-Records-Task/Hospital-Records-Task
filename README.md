## 📊 Project Overview

This project presents a 10-year analytical insight into **Massachusetts General Hospital’s** operational and financial performance using **Microsoft Power BI**.  
The analysis evaluates patterns in **admissions, encounters, procedures, and revenue**, enabling data-driven decisions for improved efficiency and patient care outcomes.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

To design an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that helps hospital stakeholders identify:
- Performance trends and cost optimization opportunities  
- Correlations between clinical efficiency and financial outcomes  
- Areas of excellence and improvement for strategic decision-making  

---

## 🧩 Work Plan

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Import hospital data into Power BI  
   - Clean and model relationships between tables: `Patients`, `Admissions`, `Procedures`, and `Payers`

2. **Measure Creation**  
   - Develop DAX measures for KPIs such as:
     - Occupancy Rate  
     - Average Length of Stay  
     - Procedure Efficiency  
     - Readmission Rate

3. **Dashboard Design**  
   - Create interactive report pages:  
     - **Landing**   [Landing ](https://github.com/Hospital-Records-Task/Hospital-Records-Task/blob/main/Dashboards%20Images/Home%20Page.png)
     - **Encounters**  [Encounters](https://github.com/Hospital-Records-Task/Hospital-Records-Task/blob/main/Dashboards%20Images/Screenshot%202025-11-10%20005858.png)
     - **Procedures**   [Procedures](https://github.com/Hospital-Records-Task/Hospital-Records-Task/blob/main/Dashboards%20Images/Screenshot%202025-11-10%20005910.png)
     - **Revenue**   [Revenue](https://github.com/Hospital-Records-Task/Hospital-Records-Task/blob/main/Dashboards%20Images/Screenshot%202025-11-10%20005924.png)
     - **Demographics**  [Demographics](https://github.com/Hospital-Records-Task/Hospital-Records-Task/blob/main/Dashboards%20Images/Screenshot%202025-11-10%20005938.png)


4. **Testing**  
   - Validate DAX calculations and KPIs for accuracy

5. **Documentation & Presentation**  
   - Prepare academic and professional reports for evaluation

## 📈 Extracted KPIs

| KPI | Value | Interpretation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **Admissions by Class** | 6 | Six distinct admission categories are monitored |
| **Avg. Encounter Duration** | 7.27 days | Indicates moderately complex inpatient cases |
| **Avg. Encounter Revenue** | $3.64K | Reflects solid revenue per encounter |
| **Avg. Length of Stay** | 0.31 days | Suggests inclusion of short-stay outpatients |
| **Avg. Procedure Duration** | 34.32 min | Efficient procedural turnaround time |
| **Avg. Procedure Revenue** | $2.03K | Strong financial return per procedure |
| **Revenue per Day** | $11.92K | High operational cost, tertiary hospital standard |
| **Coverage %** | 0.31% | High patient burden; low insurance coverage |
| **Encounter Patient Count** | 974 | Total unique patients during period |
| **Total Admissions** | 28K | Indicates hospital throughput capacity |
| **Total Encounter Revenue** | $101.51M | Matches cost, suggesting financial equilibrium |
| **Total Encounter Cost** | $101.51M | Balanced expenditure management |
| **Total Procedure Revenue** | $79.7M | Key contributor to overall revenue |
| **Total Procedure Cost** | $80M | Marginal deficit (<1%) |
| **Total Procedures** | 39K | Demonstrates large operational volume |
| **Out-of-Pocket Cost** | $70.42M | Heavy patient financial burden |
| **Total Hospital Cost** | $181.22M | Total annual expense footprint |
| **Total Payer Coverage** | $31.10M | Insurance coverage remains minimal |
| **Top Procedure Cost** | $290K | Highest-cost medical procedure |

---

## 💡 Interpretation

- **Revenue–Cost Balance:**  
  Total Encounter Revenue ($101.51M) aligns closely with total cost, indicating operational equilibrium.

- **Insurance Coverage:**  
  Out-of-Pocket Cost ($70.42M) reflects dependence on self-paying patients.  
  Coverage at only **0.31%** suggests underutilized insurance opportunities.

- **Efficiency Indicators:**  
  Procedure efficiency is strong — **34.32 minutes per procedure** and **1.41 procedures per encounter**.
